# Generally Genius (GG) Bot Framework

[Generals.io](https://generals.io/) is a fast-paced real-time strategy game with imperfect information within a 2D grid world. Players expand their land and battle with enemies in attempt to capture each others' generals. Capturing an opponent's general gives a player full control of their territory.

GIO presents an excellent testbed for AI agents through its simple set of action (up, down, left, right) in a complex state space. A gameplay supports up to 12 players, which makes it particularly challenging to select an appropriate strategy.

Generally Genius (GG) is a modular generals.io bot framework for development and analysis of game strategies and actions. CorsairCoalition is a collection of components that form the GG framework.

See the [project website](https://corsaircoalition.github.io/) for more information.
